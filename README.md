Hi, thanks for checking out this GitHub!
Whats LifeTake? Its a concept of the LifeSteal SMP youtubers did, but we're making it our own and turning it into a server!
What is this plugin? Since no plugin on spigot would do what we wanted, we decided to code it ourselves, I am mainly more of a JavaScript coder so this wasn't to easy!

I decided to make this open source to let other new and small developers learn from my code and get ideas of what they are doing wrong so they don't need to search
the internet for hours to find somebody with the same problem on something like stackoverflow or spigot forums!
